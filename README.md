# 👋 Hi, I'm Shwetabh Biswas

I'm a researcher at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, currently working on **multimodal AI**, **fake news detection**, and **deepfake detection**. My work lies at the intersection of **vision-language models**, **LLMs**, and **agentic AI systems** — with a strong focus on real-world impact and deployability.

### 🔬 Current Focus
- Multimodal Fake News Detection (WACV 2025)
- Deepfake Detection on Fully & Partially Generated Images
- Vision-Language Integration for ASR (Google Vaani Project)
- Dataset curation for Indian misinformation landscape
- Optimizing inference pipelines using vLLM and LangGraph

---

### 🧠 Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, MySQL  
- **ML & DL:** CV, NLP, Multimodal Learning, Classical ML  
- **LLM Techniques:** SFT, PEFT, RAG, Agentic Workflows  
- **Deployment:** FastAPI, Streamlit, Flask, Docker  
- **Tools:** Git, CI/CD, Hugging Face, LangGraph
